h2. Decisions made over email

h3. Apr 30, 2013

The NAACL board unanimously voted to approve funding of $5000 for NACLO in 2013 as in previous years.

h3. Mar 14, 2013

Matt Post, the publications co-chair for NAACL 2013 proposed the creation of a digital version of the program handbook for NAACL 2013. This would be a mobile app that would allow conference goers to view and organize their schedules, see which talks are being held where, and provide the information that a hard copy program handbook usually provides. The chair (Chris Callison-Burch) called for discussion on this proposal on Mar 11, 2013. 

There was a discussion among the board members. The issue of cost came up. There is a savings of $10K from discontinuing thumb drives for distributing the proceedings. We cannot save money on printing fewer hard copy program hanbooks as there is a contract in place with Omnipress to have handbooks printed this year for all attendees of NAACL 2013 (at a cost of around $3,800, about $4.50 per book). So, this year, we cannot give the option to either have the mobile app or the hardcopy program handbook. But in future conferences, there is the potential to save on printing costs if most people will use the app version of the program handbook. The development of the app for NAACL 2013 was priced at $6900 from CrowdCompass.

The board unanimously approved the expenditure for the development of the program handbook app for NAACL 2013 (only Rebecca Hwa abstained but she was away from her email). Chris Callison-Burch negotiated a better price than the earlier quote with the price for two conferences (this year's NAACL and the next year's) for $5K each. The board hopes to recover $7K extra this year, either from registration fees or from increased sponsorships to cover the additional cost.

h3. Feb 4, 2013

Chris Callison-Burch called for a discussion and subsequent vote on discontinuing thumb drives at NAACL conferences.

Matt Post, one of this year's publications co-chairs has been in contact with our publisher (Omnipress) about producing the thumb drives.  He provided them with an initial estimate of 850 USB thumb drives, based on previous years' attendance.  The estimate for producing and shipping the drives is $8,580 ($10.09 per drive).

Matt suggested that we should consider discontinuing the thumb drive or making it an optional extra that could be added at the time of registration, and that the savings could be re-directed to other distribution means (e.g. better WiFi on-site, or an App for interacting with the proceedings and conference schedule).

This matter discussed with the NAACL-HLT 2013 Program Chairs and General Chair. It was pointed out that when Hal Daume was the publication chair for ICML, they disbanded the memory sticks.  There were few complaints and the saved a lot of money.

The vote was taken by email and the following members voted YES.

Votes in favor:
* Emily Bender
* Chris Callison-Burch
* Mona Diab
* Katrin Erk
* Julia Hirschberg
* Rebecca Hwa
* Anoop Sarkar
* Joel Tetreault

Abstained:
* Graeme Hirst

There were no NO votes, so NAACL is going to implement this motion. 

A few points arose during the discussion. 

* We hope to have a few thumb drives in the registration desk for people to make copies into their devices. 
* We hope there will be a possibility to cache the proceedings on the local network obviating large fees for downloading the proceedings over the hotel wifi network.
