h2. Decisions made over email

h3. May 12, 2015

Matt Post reported on the decisions of the Emerging Regions Fund subcommittee as follows.

We received two applications for our "2015 call for funding proposals in emerging regions":../../calls/emerging_regions/2015/index.html. They are both requests for $1,500 and focus on supporting "STIL":http://bracis2015.imd.ufrn.br/events/stil/, the main Brazilian event in NLP. STIL is taking place in Natal, in the northeast of Brazil, on November 4–6. STIL is held joint with BRACIS 2015 (Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems), and ENIAC 2015 (Encontro Nacional de Inteligência Artificial e Computacional). We have funded this event in the past.

* The first will fund undergraduate students for the IV Student Workshop on Information and Language Technology (TILic), which will be hosted by the main Brazilian event on NLP &#8212; the X Symposium in Information and Human Language Technology (STIL).

* The second will be used to bring a North American invited speaker to STIL (last time, they brought Mike Riley and Andreas Stolcke). 

We allocated $3,000 for this call. These were the only two responses, and they both look good to us, so Emily and I opted to fund them both.
