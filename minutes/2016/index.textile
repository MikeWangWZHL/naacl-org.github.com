h2. 2106Q1 Report to the ACL, February 2016

* Hal reviewed the "2016Q1 NAACL Report to the ACL":http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=2016Q1_Reports:_NAACL

* This included Joel's Q1 treasurer's report, copied here:

bq. The NAACL Chapter's bank account held $90,017.12 as of December 31, 2015.  This figure takes into account the surplus from ACL 2014, but does not yet reflect the impact of the NAACL 2015 conference.  To give context for that balance, this is the highest level it has been since June 2012.  The balance for 2014 was $34k and for 2013 it was $29k.  In 2015, our expenditures were once again the sponsorship of external events: NACLO ($5k), two Emerging Regions Fund awards at $1.5k apiece ($3k) and the Summer Workshop ($6k) for a total of $14k.   In short,  2016 begins on a very strong note for NAACL.  That being said, we should continue to seek out new sources of sponsorship as many fields not previously connected with NLP, such as finance and gaming, were major sponsors for last year's NAACL.
