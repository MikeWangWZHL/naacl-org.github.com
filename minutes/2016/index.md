### Ani Nenkova's and Owen Rambow's Report on NAACL 2016

They did three things differently this year:

1. Draw a broader pool of reviewers
  - Largest ever program committee - 685 reviewers, reviewing load: 3 average, 5 max
  - Created a pool from ACL anthology past authors
  - People who had 5 papers in  last 10 years or 3 paper in last 5 years
  - Invitations went to 1400 - got 685 acceptances
  - Scripts were created for this - **TODO** we may want to capture them for the future
  - Area chairs then got to pick their reviewers
  - About 50 reviewers were silently excluded because no one picked them

2. Flexible areas
  - Wanted a more subtle approach to what an area is.
  - Areas were defined by keywords - area chairs selected keywords and then grouped by cosine similarity
  - No names were given to the resulting areas - people did complain about the missing names
  - 3 matching tasks: pairs of area of chairs, matching of reviewers to paired area chairs, matching of papers to areas
  - There were roughly 100 keywords
  - Short aside discussion about how English wasn’t on the list of languages
  - Keywords fell into 5 categories Linguistic Area, NLP area, Goal, Method, Language, Genre
  - Some question of how to encourage people to pick an answer from each category

3. Supporting reviewers
  - Want every paper to have a fair review, and want authors to understand the decision
  - Encourage ACs to make decisions together - keep areas small (40 papers)
  - They recommend - keep this approach, work on instructing ACs, keep author feedback
  - All papers got a meta-review, but this was kept hidden from the authors
  - Area chairs were encouraged to provide justifications in meta review even when the decision was clear
  - Not much one can do when a reviewer does not take part in the discussion
  - Hard to exert pressure when you have a short period between submission and decision - need more time for discussion
  - Timing was difficult due to avoiding overlap with ACL
  - Author responses serve to instigate the discussion
  - One side-effect of mixing short and long papers is that reviewers are harder on the short papers
  - Owen and Ani are preparing written report including feedback from chairs and reviewers - **TODO** Collect and archive this report
  - Ani and Owen did get some support for their process within START
  - Can we associate keywords with people’s profiles, so it’s permanent and not per-conference?
  - Ani and Owen got keywords from a Google spreadsheet - would have been nicer to get the keywords within START

### Treasurer's Report (Joel)

- Joel led discussion of [his report](NAACL_Treasurer_Report_2016_Board.pdf)
- Not sure on how NAACL 2015 did - probably lost money
- Will likely have to cut back for 2017
- Video recording still has this weird status as a conference thing we have to budget for / vote on each year
  - This makes sense on some level, as the recording does more for people *not* attending the conference
  - It is more like an NAACL outreach activity than a benefit to conference attendees
- LSA Summer Institute (which we typically fund) only happens ever second year
- Joel is encouraging us to seek out sponsorship from smaller / emerging players
  - We already have 3 - 2 global sponsorship chairs and 1 local sponsorship chair (and Priscilla and Joel)
  - Since we’ve gotten rid of the student lunch, we might consider doing a recruitment lunch
  - Could we approach some companies specifically to fund the ERF? Many ERF applicants just want travel support.
  - What about a Video Recording sponsor? Company could put their name on the page
- Priscilla's sponsorship summary:
  - We got $70k for the main conference
  - Got a lot of 3-pack (NAACL, ACL, EMNLP) sponsors this year, many at gold level
  - A number of silver sponsors approached us late
  - We are doing a little bit better than last year, just with our standard sponsors
- Could we co-locate with other conferences (machine learning, linguistics)?
  - Financial benefit of collocation depends heavily on cross-over
  - Collocation is actually less work for Priscilla
- Is it possible to move when we commit to funds to after when we know about the results from a conference?
  - Moving ERF is easy, but we don't want it to be cut more often
- **TODO**: Joel volunteered to spearhead the NAACL Inc. sponsorship effort
  - Priscilla did not like the idea of folding NAACL Inc. sponsorship into *ACL conference sponsorship
  - Any time after ACL would be a good time to approach organizations for sponsorship
  - Hit as early in the fall as possible - give them time to think about it before January

### ACL Treasurer's Report (Graeme)

- The ACL's bookkeeping is currently in rough shape
- Some costs/credits have been misassigned, will be some time before we have a clear financial picture for NAACL 2015
- But why do we have a loss at all?
  - Even with more people registering, costs still go up
  - Line dancing was expensive, Denver is an expensive city
  - Food is expensive, we are perhaps getting more than we need to fulfill our room requirements
  - But there are perks (many intangible, such as leverage) to being a big customer for these hotels
- Regarding food
  - Good to get everyone together, but it's too bad there aren't many chance for self-organized dinners out
  - Conference is becoming all-inclusive
- We could drop breakfasts without losing leverage
  - Past experiments with dropping breakfast have upset conference attendees

### 2016Q1 Report to the ACL, February 2016 (Emily)
- Emily reviewed the [2016Q1 NAACL Report to the ACL](http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=2016Q1_Reports:_NAACL)
- This included Joel's Q1 treasurer's report, copied here:

> The NAACL Chapter's bank account held $90,017.12 as of December 31, 2015. This figure takes into account the surplus from ACL 2014, but does not yet reflect the impact of the NAACL 2015 conference. To give context for that balance, this is the highest level it has been since June 2012. The balance for 2014 was $34k and for 2013 it was $29k. In 2015, our expenditures were once again the sponsorship of external events: NACLO ($5k), two Emerging Regions Fund awards at $1.5k apiece ($3k) and the Summer Workshop ($6k) for a total of $14k. In short, 2016 begins on a very strong note for NAACL. That being said, we should continue to seek out new sources of sponsorship as many fields not previously connected with NLP, such as finance and gaming, were major sponsors for last year's NAACL.

### ACL 2017 (Priscilla / Emily)
- ACL 2017 will be in Vancouver in August - July 30
- Two handoff meetings coming up

### NAACL 2018 & 2019 (Priscilla / Emily)
- Priscilla would prefer to negotiate two years at once, both at the same chain
- Collecting ideas for locations
- Priscilla has good contacts at Starwood, Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton - Starwood would like us to do New Orleans
- NAACL Board is in favour of negotiating another 2 years
- What Priscilla needs for a 2-year plan:
  - Suggestions for general areas on the map (Boston and points north is an example area)
  - Couple of states here, couple there, to give Priscilla some direction
  - Hal has the results of a survey: Chicago, Boston, Austin, Toronto, New Orleans, Miami, Honolulu, Salt Lake, Vegas, Montreal, DC
- Feasibility of Latin / South America?
  - Graeme and Priscilla have done some preliminary explorations
  - No clear candidates at this point, don’t know about Mexico City
  - Would definitely need a local to help bridge cultural, linguistic barriers
  - Would make sense for NAACL to do a SA conference before ACL, NAACL has the mandate, and it is smaller
- What if we had a goal to host an Central/South American NAACL in 10 years?
  - Is the ERF serving that goal? Could we do more?
  - Would it make sense to send researchers from the NA universities to visit LA/SA?
- Would be Western tourist destinations be reasonable?
  - Can scare off government sponsors, would still be more difficult than North America

### Elections (Colin)
- Last year we had 25% voter turnout
- Nominations September 1
- Members notified of nominations on September 15
- Nominating Committee has been assembled:
  - Rebecca Hwa
  - Anoop Sarkar
  - Mona Diab *Chair*
  - Katrin Erk
  - Julia Hirschberg
  - Michael White
  - Eduard Hovy
- Colin needs support running elections software
  - Jim Harmond at Ohio State helped last year, Marie confirms that he will help again
- Should we have another board position?
  - Could help with concerns about having enough people eligible to be Chair
  - Could also help with expanding workload, sponsorship
  - **TODO**: Emily to draft proposal to expand the board, so membership can vote on expansion in the next election

### Latin America Report (Joel and Fei)
- Joel walked us through his [slides](Latin_America_Report_2016.pdf)
- Most popular request for support is travel support to attend NAACL
- Second most popular is funding to have top researchers visit
  - What about a video classroom that could capture a broader audience?
  - What is the expectation of the English language capability of the students we would encounter with an outreach visit?
  - Are there Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking North American researchers that we could tap for outreach?
- Many researchers commented that our conference focus hinders their ability to get promotions, which depend on journal papers.
  - We could promote TACL to this audience, which would also get them invited to the conference
  - TACL is not currently indexed by Thompson Reuters - still not great for promotions
- This survey and mailing list already reflects big strides toward improving communication with LA
- What about sending the Jelinek summer school to LA?
  - Machine learning summer school in Portugal? Seems to have a lot of *ACL people
- **TODO**: report back the results of the survey to the community
- **TODO**: reach out to the LA community to encourage them to submit a workshop to ACL in Vancouver
- Thamar Solario highlighted as someone who can help with organization

### Report on Author Response (Marie-Catherine & Hal)
- Slides are [here](NAACL_Area_Chair_Decision_Survey_Results.pdf)
- Sent a survey to area chairs to get an idea of usage of author responses
- Review text and discussion were most important factor in a borderline paper
- Area chairs are not really considering nitty-gritty scores - but they can be helpful to the reviewer to force them to think about the issues
- Best practices for an author response
  - thank the reviewers, be positive
  - prime expectations: it’s not going to be a big difference
  - you maybe anonymous to the reviewers, but not to the area chair
- Structure the timeline to encourage discussion
  - Very helpful to prime a discussion with a summary of positions by AC
- One concern that keeps coming up is can we provide a person’s score history
  - What is person X’s histogram for an accepted/rejected paper
  - Or with respect to other scores

### Report on START (Matt and Colin)
- Putting together a list of rough edges and ideas that could improve experience for chairs, ACs, reviewers, submitters
  - Effort is being organized here: [https://trello.com/b/TxoPbCfM/start-wishlist](https://trello.com/b/TxoPbCfM/start-wishlist)
  - Going to recruit Kevin Duh for a list of concerns re: PC Chairs- 
- Rich at Softconf is located at UMD right above Hal
- Hal has a bunch of scripts that he uses to make START more helpful, probably others have scripts as well
- Proposal exists to have START cover smaller ACL-affiliated stand-alone events. This is orthogonal to technical improvements discussed here.
- CMT - Microsoft Conference Management toolkit - competitor that came up several times

### Should NAACL joint the Computing Research Association (CRA)? (Julia)
- Slides are [here](NAACL_and_CRA.pdf)
- Fees are large enough to be felt as a meaningful budget item
- TODO Hal: Talk to Lise Getoor re: AAAI’s benefits from being a CRA member

### Plan for Business Meeting (Emily)
Issues from last business meeting:
- Public reviews - split 50-50
- Accessibility chair at NAACL
  - Close captioning of video
  - Priscilla: this cost $3,500 last year for a limited number of tracks
  - Would there be a way to do this live for all tracks?
  - Microsoft may be developing an AI-based solution
- Award categories?
  - Best new data source?
  - Best student paper?
  - Best reproduction of a previous result?
  - Most reproducible paper?
