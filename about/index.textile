h3. About the naacl.org website

This website was designed and developed by "Anoop Sarkar":http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop (Secretary of the NAACL board from 2009-2012) in 2012 to deliver on an election promise to create a new naacl.org website.

Thanks to the students from the "SFU Natural Language Lab":http://natlang.cs.sfu.ca for helping to port information from the older hand-written HTML site to the new on, especially thanks to Max Whitney and Marzieh Razavi.

The website was built using "jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/ and is hosted on "github":http://github.com. The website source can be viewed on the "naacl-org github repository":https://github.com/naacl-org/naacl-org.github.com.

The readme.md file on the github repository explains how to maintain the website and add new information, such as new posts, minutes, officers, etc.
