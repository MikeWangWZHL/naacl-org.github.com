The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of a NAACL conference; these require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. For these reasons, we have created an explicit anti-harassment policy for NAACL conferences.
