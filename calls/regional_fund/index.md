stub. 

preferable behavior:

all of the ERF pages should be migrated here, and redirects placed in the emerging_regions folder. this preserves all old URLs, but also correctly nixes the old name. con: sit down and write all the redirect stuff.

or, only the 2021-and-onwards pages should be here, and point to the old ERF pages. this preserves all the old content in situ, but allows for name update. con: new pages need to always include pointer to old stuff.
