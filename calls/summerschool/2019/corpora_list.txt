Call For NAACL Scholarship Applications To The Two-Week Undergraduate
Summer School At The 2019 Annual Jelinek Memorial Workshop On Speech
And Language Technology (JSALT)

The North American Chapter of the Association for Computational
Linguistics (NAACL) is again offering an exciting summer school
opportunity for a limited number of undergraduate students interested
in the field of Human Language Technology.

What is this scholarship for?

A continuation of the Johns Hopkins University CLSP summer workshop
series from 1995-2018, JSALT brings notable researchers and students
together to collaborate on selected research topics for six weeks,
following a special two-week undergraduate education session.  Those
first two weeks provide students with general introductions to the
major areas of study within the field of Human Language Technology
(e.g., Natural Language Processing, Automatic Speech Recognition,
Machine Translation, Information Retrieval), as well as sessions on
specialized research topics of current interest in the field.

What does the scholarship cover?

The NAACL scholarship is used to support undergraduate students from
the Americas to participate in the two-week summer school.
Specifically, it covers the mandatory registration and housing costs
for the full duration. In addition, up to $500 USD will be given to
the student to offset travel costs. Additional travel support may be
available for students with exceptionally high travel costs. Meals and
other incidental expenses are not covered.

Who can apply for this scholarship?

Students must be enrolled or pre-enrolled at an institution in the
Americas to qualify. Preference will be given to high-quality
undergraduate students at a stage in their careers during which
attendance at the summer school will provide maximum benefit; in
particular, undergraduates who have completed at least their junior
year of study. Graduate and Postdoctoral applications will not be
accepted. Students who are selected for the summer school are expected
to attend all two weeks of the summer school.
